A simple backend API that allows users to chat with movie characters.

- Accepts POST requests with a `character` and `user_message`.
- Returns a response that mimics the character's personality (currently, it just reverses the message).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/1raiyan1/Movie_chatbot.git
